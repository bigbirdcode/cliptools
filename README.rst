Goal
----

Clipboard manager with text processing tools.

Yes, there are many clipboard managers, but I had this idea, how to make it simple and effective. 

Programming language: Python and wxPython.

Inspiration
-----------

The book Fluent Python by Luciano Ramalho, https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/ inspired me to start some new projects. I especially liked the unicode part, as the examples were really great and solved the problems what I have with the Hungarian language.

Thonny, Python IDE for beginners at https://thonny.org/ has interesting structure. I borrowed the starting part with the delegation handling sockets.

And of course Python and wxPython are great!

Concept
-------

I assigned a keyboard shortcut to the ClipTools app. So it is started by just a key combination. Then I can easily select a group of texts, the actual text, the processing action just by the number keys from 1 to 9. Finally the result is copied to the clipboard.

Status
------

Work has just started. I would say feasibility study was successful. And I'm also learning Github. Please be patient.
